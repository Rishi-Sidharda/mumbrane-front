Got it. I’ll keep this **clean, grounded, and non-hypey**, but still sharp enough to carry a serious product.

## Product Description (Website-ready)

**A digital employee powered by a Cognitive Operating System.**

We built a Cognitive OS that treats an LLM’s context window the same way humans use working memory — not as a prompt hack, but as a first-class system primitive.

The result is a digital employee that **thinks, remembers, collaborates, and operates** like a human — but at superhuman scale.

Unlike today’s production agents, this system is **reliable, auditable, and governable** by design. Every action, decision, memory, and interaction is traceable. Nothing is “magic,” nothing disappears into prompts.

This digital employee can:

- Remember conversations across time
- Attend meetings with other digital employees
- Collaborate asynchronously like a real team member
- Interact with humans naturally
- Execute complex workstreams end-to-end

In practice, one digital employee replaces an entire team — without the brittleness, opacity, or chaos of current agent systems.

## Founder-Grade Version (Direct, no fluff)

We didn’t build an agent.
We built a **Cognitive OS**.

Agents today are unreliable because they’re just stateless tools glued together with prompts. We took a different approach: we modeled **working memory, long-term memory, decision boundaries, and accountability** directly into the operating system.

This makes the system behave like a human employee — not a workflow script.

That’s why it can:

- Recall past context naturally
- Coordinate with other digital employees
- Be audited, governed, and trusted in production

This isn’t augmentation.
It’s a **drop-in replacement for a team of ~10 people**.

## Positioning vs “AI Agents” (implicit but clear)

| Agents Today                   | Your Digital Employee                 |
